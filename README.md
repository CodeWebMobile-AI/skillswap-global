## 15. Foundational Architecture Details

### 1. Core Components & Rationale

The architecture is built around a modular and scalable approach. The backend is a Laravel API, serving a React frontend built with Inertia.js and TypeScript. Redis is used for real-time functionality.
*Justification:* This combination leverages Laravel's robust features and ecosystem with React's component-based UI, and Inertia.js simplifies the communication between the two. TypeScript adds type safety and improves code maintainability. Redis offers a fast and reliable pub/sub mechanism for real-time updates. [Source: Laravel Documentation, React Documentation, Inertia.js Documentation, Redis Documentation]

### 2. Database Schema Design

The database schema will include the following tables:

*   `users`: id, name, email, password, profile_picture, bio, location, language, verification_status, created_at, updated_at
*   `skills`: id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
*   `user_skills`: user_id (FK), skill_id (FK), level, created_at, updated_at
*   `projects`: id, user_id (FK), title, description, status, created_at, updated_at
*   `project_skills`: project_id (FK), skill_id (FK), required_level, created_at, updated_at
*   `swaps`: id, initiator_user_id (FK), receiver_user_id (FK), project_id (FK), status, created_at, updated_at
*   `swap_skills`: swap_id (FK), skill_id (FK), provided_by, level, created_at, updated_at
*   `reviews`: id, swap_id (FK), reviewer_user_id (FK), reviewee_user_id (FK), rating, comment, created_at, updated_at
*   `languages`: id, name, code, created_at, updated_at
*   `user_languages`: user_id (FK), language_id (FK), proficiency, created_at, updated_at

Relationships are defined using Laravel's Eloquent ORM. Indexes are crucial for performance. [Source: Laravel Eloquent Documentation, Database Design Best Practices]

### 3. API Design & Key Endpoints

A RESTful API using Laravel's resource controllers and API resources. API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`) is essential. Authentication will be handled via Sanctum for SPA authentication and Passport for OAuth (potentially for third-party integrations later). Key endpoints include:

*   `/api/v1/users`: CRUD operations for users.
*   `/api/v1/skills`: CRUD operations for skills.
*   `/api/v1/projects`: CRUD operations for projects.
*   `/api/v1/swaps`: CRUD operations for swaps.
*   `/api/v1/reviews`: CRUD operations for reviews.
*   `/api/v1/auth/login`: User login.
*   `/api/v1/auth/register`: User registration.
*   `/api/v1/auth/logout`: User logout.
*   `/api/v1/auth/me`: Get authenticated user.

Rate limiting is implemented using Laravel's built-in mechanisms. Input validation is enforced using Laravel's validation rules. [Source: Laravel Routing Documentation, Laravel API Resources Documentation, Laravel Sanctum Documentation, Laravel Passport Documentation]

### 4. Frontend Structure (TypeScript)

The frontend is structured with React components, using TypeScript for type safety. A common directory structure includes:

*   `Components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, cards).
*   `Pages/`: Page-level components (e.g., Home, Profile, ProjectDetails).
*   `Layouts/`: Layout components (e.g., MainLayout, AuthLayout).
*   `Hooks/`: Custom React hooks for managing state and logic.
*   `Types/`: TypeScript type definitions for API responses and component props.
*   `Services/`: API client (using Axios or similar) for making requests to the backend.
*   `Utils/`: Utility functions (e.g., date formatting, string manipulation).

State management will be handled using React Context API or Zustand for simplicity. Global state can be managed with Redux or Recoil for larger-scale state management if the application complexity increases. [Source: React Component Structure Best Practices, TypeScript Best Practices]

### 5. Real-time & Events Architecture

Redis is used as the message broker, and `laravel-echo-server` provides a WebSocket server. Laravel events are broadcast via Redis channels.  Frontend components subscribe to these channels using `laravel-echo`.  For example, a `NewMessage` event can be broadcast when a new chat message is created. The frontend then listens to this event and updates the chat UI. Private channels are used for user-specific events (e.g., notifications). Authentication for private channels is handled by Laravel Echo's authentication endpoint. [Source: Laravel Broadcasting Documentation, laravel-echo-server Documentation, Redis Pub/Sub Documentation]

### 6. Authentication & Authorization Flow

Sanctum is used for authentication, providing SPA authentication via API tokens.  When a user logs in, Sanctum issues a token. This token is stored in the browser's local storage or cookies (with appropriate security attributes). The frontend then includes this token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests.  Authorization is handled using Laravel's policies.  Policies define which users are allowed to perform specific actions on specific resources.  For example, a policy might define that only the owner of a project can edit it.  Middleware is used to protect API endpoints based on these policies. [Source: Laravel Sanctum Documentation, Laravel Authorization Documentation]

### 7. Deployment & Scalability Plan

The application will be deployed on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean. Docker is used for containerization to ensure consistent environments. Database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) can be on a separate instance or using managed database services. Redis will be deployed separately as well, potentially using a managed Redis service for scalability. Load balancing is implemented to distribute traffic across multiple application instances. Horizontal scaling is achieved by adding more application instances behind the load balancer. Caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis caching, HTTP caching) are employed to reduce database load. A CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar is set up for automated deployments. [Source: Docker Documentation, Cloud Provider Documentation, CI/CD Best Practices]

### 8. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy includes:

*   **Backend:** Pest for unit and feature tests.  Tests cover API endpoints, business logic, and database interactions.
*   **Frontend:** Vitest and React Testing Library (RTL) for unit and component tests. Tests cover UI components, state management, and API integrations.
*   **End-to-end (E2E) tests:** Playwright or Cypress for testing the entire application flow.  These tests simulate user interactions and verify that the application functions correctly from end to end.

Test Driven Development (TDD) is encouraged to ensure high test coverage. Automated testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. [Source: Pest Documentation, Vitest Documentation, React Testing Library Documentation, Playwright Documentation, Cypress Documentation]

### 9. Security & Hardening Plan

A 'security-first' approach addressing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:

*   **Input Validation:** Laravel's validation rules and middleware are used to validate all user inputs.
*   **Output Encoding:** Data is properly encoded before being displayed to prevent XSS attacks.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Sanctum and Laravel's policies are used for secure authentication and authorization.
*   **Password Hashing:** Bcrypt hashing is used for password storage.
*   **SQL Injection Prevention:** Eloquent ORM is used to prevent SQL injection attacks.
*   **CSRF Protection:** Laravel's CSRF protection middleware is enabled.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Laravel's rate limiting is used to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regular security audits are conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities using Composer and NPM.
*   **HTTPS:** The application is served over HTTPS to encrypt traffic.

Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented to prevent XSS attacks. [Source: OWASP Top 10, Laravel Security Documentation]

### 10. Logging & Observability

Laravel's logging facilities are used to log application events. A dedicated `stderr` channel is configured to send logs to standard error, which can be collected by a log management system (e.g., ELK stack, Graylog).  Structured logging (e.g., JSON format) is used for easier parsing and analysis.  Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) are used to monitor key metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, response time, and error rate.  Alerts are configured to notify administrators of critical issues. Distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) is used to track requests across different services.
